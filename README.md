### What I built
I built a website that helps users find information regarding neighborhoods in the city of Knoxville.

### Who it is useful for
This is useful for anyone who wishes to find specific information regarding neighborhoods in the city of Knoxville.

### Why I built it
My inspiration was the problem statement on the main website and because I was having trouble navigating the Knoxville website myself. Furthermore, I wanted to take this chance to learn web-scraping, which is something I needed to do in this project.
